        <h2>What is Angular?</h2>
        <p>Angular is a popular open-source framework for building web applications. Developed and maintained by Google, Angular provides a comprehensive set of tools and features that simplify the development process.</p>

        <h2>Key Features of Angular</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Declarative Templates:</strong> Angular uses HTML to define the UI of an application in a declarative manner.</li>
            <li><strong>Two-Way Data Binding:</strong> Angular's two-way data binding ensures that changes in the UI automatically update the application state, and vice versa.</li>
            <li><strong>Modularity:</strong> Angular promotes the development of modular applications, making it easier to manage and scale large codebases.</li>
            <li><strong>Dependency Injection:</strong> Angular's dependency injection system helps organize and manage the components of an application.</li>
        </ul>
